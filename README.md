# video-streaming
incrementally building a video streaming Node.JS server. Adding features and protocols/technologies as I learn more around the topic.

How to run after cloning, cd into the "video-streaming" folder and run following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Then open the following url in your browser (localhost on port 8000):
```
127.0.0.1:8000/
```
Next TO-DO:

add authentication

add feature to select bit-rate by end-user
- Namely: 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 4k, Auto=Adaptive Bit-rate Streaming

check node-fluent-ffmpeg ka kya lafda hai?

add more vids to homepage and let user click on thumbnails to select which one to watch - configure frontend + backend routes and all i.e. automate for entire vid library instead of just one vid...

MAYBE:

hook up front-end to REACT APP instead of just normal HTML and add buttons to video player such as fwd-10secs, reverse-10sec, auto-generate subs, look for more features that make using a video player much more smoother UX.
